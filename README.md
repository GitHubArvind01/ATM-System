## Description
This ATM System is a Java-based application designed as a prototype to simulate basic ATM functionalities. It allows users to perform five operations:

- **Withdrawal**: Allows users to withdraw a specific amount from their account balance.
- **Amount Check**: Displays the current balance available in the account.
- **ATM Pin Change**: Enables users to change their ATM pin.
- **Mini Statement**: Displays recent transactions (currently simulated).
- **Exit**: Exits the ATM system.

The system is implemented using Java with functions, methods, classes, conditionals, loops, and exception handling using `try-catch` blocks. It provides a prototype for real-time transaction handling and will be enhanced with database integration and security measures in future versions.

## Features
- Basic ATM operations like withdrawal, balance check, pin change, mini statement, and exit.
- User authentication using ATM PIN.
- Exception handling for invalid inputs or operations.

## Current Status
This ATM system is in its prototype phase. The following improvements are planned for the next stages:
1. **Database Integration**: To store transaction data and user information in real-time.
2. **Security Enhancements**: To ensure secure data handling, especially during transactions and user authentication.
3. **Public Deployment**: The system will be ready for deployment after the integration of the database and security improvements.

## Technologies Used
- **Java**: The core programming language used for building the ATM system.
- **Functions/Methods**: Used to modularize the code for different ATM operations.
- **Classes and Objects**: To organize the code structure and implement user operations.
- **Conditionals (If-else, Switch-case)**: To handle different user choices and operations.
- **Loops**: For continuous user interaction until the operation is completed or exited.
- **Try-Catch**: To handle errors and exceptions, ensuring smooth operation.
